*The assistant that helps you get the maximum value from the Dynatrace platform.*

This Dashboard highly leverages code tiles to perform a wide and deep analysis of your actual state of configuration and adoption of top Dynatrace capabilities.

Admins can download and import the JSON definition of the DTR Dashboard in their own tenant to discover what fundamentals, best practices and recommendations they should prioritize and implement to maximize Dynatrace's positive impact in their organization.

The Dynatrace Tenant Review is:
 - Safe: The Dashboards app and the DTR are both restricted to read-only permissions/calls by design. Furthermore, no data ever leaves the Dynatrace tenant.
 - Fast: The analytics happens where the data resides, in Grailâ„¢.
 - Open source: Copy, inspect, customize and share it in a few clicks!
